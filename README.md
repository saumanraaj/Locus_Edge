# LocusEdge

**LocusEdge** is a mobile robot system designed to operate with offline Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling natural language-based control without internet connectivity. It is built for environments with limited or no network access and uses ROS for robotic control.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Offline LLM inference using fine-tuned LLaMA 3
- Speech-to-text via Whisper
- ROS integration for autonomous navigation
- Natural language command interpretation and execution
- Gazebo simulation and real-world deployment
- 3D-printable robot hardware
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for 3D scene reconstruction (experimental)

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Python
- Whisper (speech-to-text)
- LLaMA 3 (fine-tuned)
- Gazebo Simulator
- NeRF (for 3D reconstruction)
- Docker (for containerization)
